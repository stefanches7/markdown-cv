## Work experience

`08.2022-11.2022`	
Neuroscience Application Developer placement at <br> __Georgia State University, USA__ 
- • Group ICA runs and documentation of the analysis to get users 3x more effectively. This software helps to cure neurological diseases worldwide, a burden worth US 1,7 trillion $ a year.
<hr>
`07.2022-08.2022`	
Computational Neuroscientist placement at <br> __Aston University, UK__ 
- • Improved network connectivity measurements to reduce bias more than 3-fold. This allows for a smoother network model, saving >30k€ on each experiment.
<hr>
`08.2021-06.2022`
Data Analyst at __PainLab Munich__
- • Analyzed digital biomarkers of Chronic Pain to reduce up to 85% manual processing costs. Automated diagnosis is also at least 3x faster.
<hr>
`04.2021-07.2021`
Application Engineer at __Mentalab__
-  • Developed brain-computer interface use cases to advertise the product. This helped 33% faster user conversion.
<hr>
`10.2020-03.2021`
IT Architecture Developer at __STABL GmbH__
-  • Improved the remote control of battery racks and code quality in the company, saving maintenance costs by 70%.
<hr>
`05.2019-08.2019`
Google Summer of Code '19 Student with __International Neuroinformatics Coordination Facility__
- • Trained Machine Learning capable agents for Cognitive Science experiments. The software reduces time-to-first-plot by est. 64%.
<hr>
`01.2018-09.2020`
Assistant Researcher at the __Chair for Computational Molecular Medicine__, TUM
- • Applied statistical models to clinical data with R/knitr to investigate disease details, worked on new niches for bioinformatics analysis. Bioinformatic models significantly speed up biological discovery.
<hr>
`05.2017-08.2017`
Google Summer of Code with __European Bioinformatics Institute, EMBL__, Cambrige, UK
- • Speeded up file search by 153% for ca. 63 million daily web requests.
<hr>
`01.2017-08.2017`	 
Student Developer at __Omikron Data Quality GmbH__ 
- • Website and backend JavaScript database SRM maintenance. My role helped to achieve a more useable website, and 0,02% boilerplate code reduction.
 <hr>
`10.2016-11.2016`	
Junior Project Manager at __Deutsche Payment GmbH (Berlin)__ 
- • Hands-on project manager training and cross-departmental communication. I have saved 30k€ with combination of seniority and efficiency.

<hr>

## Education

`10.2017-09.2020`
__B.Sc. Bioinformatics__ at the TU Munich/LMU Munich <br> (joint study program)
- • Average grade: __1,9__ (best – 1,0; worst – 5,0)
- • Thesis: SARS-CoV-2 variants in RNASeq data. The developed pipeline helped investigate communal infection in hospitals.
<hr>
`10.2020-09.2023`
__Elite M. Sc. Neuroengineering__ in Elite Network of Bavaria,<br> __TU Munich__
- • Average grade: __2,2__ (best – 1,0; worst – 5,0)
- • Thesis: SNN model of in vitro 2D neuronal networks. This model saves up to 60k€ per experiment through computer simulation.
